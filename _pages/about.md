Since August 2020, I am working as a <em>junior lecturer</em> at the Artificial intelligence master program at University of Amsterdam (UvA). My contribution is in multiple courses: Machine learning, Deep learning, Fairness Accountability Confidentiality and Transparency in AI and Explainability and Interpretability in AI. Part of my role is to prepare materials, lectures and tutorials for all these courses.

I have acquired my Ph.D. from data science and knowledge engineering (DKE) at Maastricht University on cross-modal emotion recognition based on domain adaptation. My work utilized methods to bridge expressivity features from the audio and visual modalities and ways to elicit both in order to improve emotion recognition performance.

Christos Athanasiadis was born in February 1988 in Drama, Greece. In 2010 he completed his bachelor degree in the Department of computer science in Aristotle University in Greece, where he also earned his master degree as well in the \textit{Digital Media, Computational Intelligence} program. In his master thesis, he studied machine learning methods for developing intelligent agents in strategy video game <em>StarCraft</em>.
