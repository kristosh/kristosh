I have started working on UvA as a junior lecturer at the Artificial intelligence master program. My contribution is in multiple courses: Machine learning, Deep learning, Fairness Accountability Confidentiality and Transparency in AI and Explainability and Interpretability in AI. Part of my role is to prepare materials, lectures and tutorials for all these courses.
