I have defended my PhD thesis on cross-modal emotion recognition based on domain adaptation. My work utilized methods to bridge expressivity features from the audio and visual modalities and ways to elicit both in order to improve emotion recognition performance. The event took place on Aula Maastricht University, Minderbroedersberg 4-6, 6211 LK Maastricht, The Netherlands. The event was open to the public. The thesis is available [here](https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/portal/files/29486791/Christos_Athanasiadis_Thesis.pdf).
